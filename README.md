> because even a bad queue is better than no queue at all

CMQ (config map queue) is a dumb idea of an application. For real, please don't use this in production. This takes a Kubernetes configMap and turns it into a queue. Why? Because I can and because its there. 

Inspired by ConsulMQ (github.com/peterfraedrich/consulmq)
